Hi <%= @name %>,<br/><br/>

I'm Carlos, the founder of Dapper Box.  I'm sad to see you go.<br/><br/>  

We're always looking to improve so I was wondering if maybe we could make this situation a win/win.<br/><br/>

We've found that users who cancelled have given us the most valuable feedback in improving our experience & products.<br/><br/> 

We created a program called Beta Box where you'd continue to get a monthly box for a steeply discounted price (only $15 / month) and in return you'd give active feedback on the items we send out.<br/><br/>

Just shoot me an email if you're interested.  No hard feelings if not.<br/><br/>

All the best,<br/><br/>

Carlos<br/>
Founder, Dapper Box
